## Commercial projects
### AI projects
**Events prediction**
<br />
Several techniques used for prediction of events that came into centralized alarm system implemented on production hall.
<br />
*Skills: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Jupyter Notebook*
<br />

**Hydraulic oil-pump predictive maintenance**
<br />
Classification and regression algorithms used for prediction of oil-pump failure. Interestingly, distinction depending on different kind of failure was made.
* First stage of a project was to indicate if "someting is going wrong with the pump".
* Second stage was to distinct what kind of failure will appear.
* The late stage was to perform multidimensional regression task and to estimate approximately when the pump will fail.

Algorithms used: RandomForestClassifier, MLP with softmax layer, DecisionTreeClassifier, GaussianNB, SGDClassifier
Because of lack of data during training and model deployment StratifiedKFold cross-validation was be performed.
<br />
*Skills: Python, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Microsoft Azure, Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Jupyter Notebook*
<br />

**High pressure aggregate anomaly detection**
<br />

<br />
### IT projects
**"MOLOS IoT - real-time machines monitoring"**

<br />
**"Adaptive Machine Vision"**
<br />
The biggest project I have been involved into. My main responsibilities are:
  * Development of highly efficient and stable algorithms for image processing.
